    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Prepare the toppings ahead of time. Chashu and ajitsuke tamago should be prepared 1 day in advance.
      <li>Mince or press 2 cloves of garlic and add to a small plate.
      <li>Add 1/2 tsp of grated ginger to the same plate.
      <li>Mince 1 shallot and add to the same plate, then set this plate aside.
      <li>Grind 1 Tbsp of toasted white sesame seeds, leaving some seeds unground for texture. Set aside.
      <li>Preheat a medium pot over medium-low heat. When it's hot, add 1 Tbsp of toasted sesame oil, followed by the garlic, ginger and shallot.
      <li>Using a wooden spatula, stir-fry until it is fragrant.
      <li>Add 1/4 lb of ground pork and increase the heat to medium. Cook the meat until it's no longer pink.
      <li>Add 1 tsp of doubanjiang and 3 Tbsp of miso. Quickly blend well with the meat before they get burnt.
      <li>Add the ground sesame seeds and 1 Tbsp of sugar. Mix well.
      <li>Add 1 Tbsp of sake and 4 cups of chicken stock. Bring the mixture to a simmer.
      <li>Taste the soup and if necessary, add 1 tsp of kosher salt. Then, add 1/4 tsp of white pepper powder.
      <li>Cover the soup broth with the lid and let it simmer.
      <li>Bring a large pot of unsalted water to a boil. Once it is boiling, ladle some of the hot water into the individual ramen bowls to warm them up. Meanwhile, gently shake 2 servings of fresh ramen noodles with your hand to separate and loosen them up.
      <li>Cook the noodles according to the package instructions. Before the noodles are done, empty the hot water from the warmed ramen bowls.
      <li>When the noodles are done, quickly pick them up with a mesh seive and shake out the excess water. This is to avoid diluting the soup. Serve the noodles into the warmed bowls.
      <li>Add the piping-hot ramen soup broth to each bowl.
      <li>Place the toppings of your choice on the ramen noodles and serve immediately. Add the optional condiments to your ramen and enjoy.
